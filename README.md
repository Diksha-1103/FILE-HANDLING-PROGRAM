**DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK**

In C, file handling allows us to create, open, read, write, and append data to files using functions from the standard I/O library (stdio.h). Below is a description of writing, reading, and appending in file handling:

(A) Opening a File:
      The fopen() function is used to open a file. It takes two arguments: the file name and the mode. Modes specify the intended operation, such as: 
      "r": Opens for reading. The file must exist.
      "w": Opens for writing. Overwrites if the file exists, or creates a new one if not.
      "a": Opens for appending. Adds data to the end of the file.
      "r+": Opens for both reading and writing. The file must exist.
      "w+": Opens for both reading and writing. Overwrites if the file exists, or creates a new one if not.
      "a+": Opens for both reading and appending. Creates a new file if it doesn't exist.
      Binary modes such as "rb", "wb", "ab", "rb+", "wb+" and "ab+" are used for binary files.

(B) Reading from a File:
      fscanf(): Reads formatted data from a file, similar to scanf().
      fgets(): Reads a line of text from a file.
      fgetc(): Reads a single character from a file.
      
(C) Writing to a File:
      fprintf(): Writes formatted data to a file, similar to printf().
      fputs(): Writes a string to a file.
      fputc(): Writes a single character to a file.
      fwrite(): Writes a block of memory to a file.
      
(D) Appending to a File:
      The "a" or "a+" mode is used to open a file for appending. New data is added at the end of the existing content.
